Vanilla Lantern
============

Firefox OS - Lantern App

A simple app with a white screen (and some instructions in a black background).
My insterest was in trying priviledged and certifies APIs, in this case, forcing full brightness and changing it back.


Because certified apps are really dangerous (As you can see in the comments of the settings result, too much control), you can use this to study about it or something like that.



Current status: Working, but with fixed options because a certain feature is not yet implemented.
